	Trivial update to .gitignore-s.

	BUGFIXES:
	    1. not sure if this has always been the case, but the Pinboard
	       API is returning a UTF-8 BOM at the start of the response
	       text; strip that before parsing
	    2. the response JSON doesn't always return a Short for use counts;
	       sometimes it returns a Number-- handle that.

	Publishing to crates.io.

	Prep for initial release:
	    1. bugfix in parsing JSON returned from Instapaper
	    2. updated assorted boilerplate
