	First 0.2.0 commit

2022-08-28  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Implemented `rename-tag`.

	This commit is a working Stream implementation that consumes an iterator of tags & URLs to be deleted and produces URLs, together with a non-trivial unit test suite.
	The `delete` sub-command has been implemented, as well.

	Initial 0.2 re-write.
	This is a major commit that essentially re-writes `pin`. The program
	is now:

	    - async
	    - supports bulk operations (send, initially)
	    - support backoff & retry on bulk send
	    - incorporates Mockito for unit tests (rather than the trait-
	      based approach)

	Switched from log4rs to tracing.

2022-07-26  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Upgraded `pin` to Clap 3.2.

2021-08-02  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Update Cargo.toml for packaging.

2021-08-02  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Repair broken build.
	The `clap` project released a new beta that broke earlier builds.
	This commit:

	    - updates to *exactly* 3.0.0-beta.2
	    - updates the copyright statements throughout to 2021

2020-08-01  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Trivial update to .gitignore-s.

2020-06-17  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	BUGFIXES:
	    1. not sure if this has always been the case, but the Pinboard
	       API is returning a UTF-8 BOM at the start of the response
	       text; strip that before parsing
	    2. the response JSON doesn't always return a Short for use counts;
	       sometimes it returns a Number-- handle that.

2020-05-31  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Publishing to crates.io.

	Prep for initial release:
	    1. bugfix in parsing JSON returned from Instapaper
	    2. updated assorted boilerplate
