*** Bugfixes

**** Fix the build

The `clap` project released a new beta at the end of last year which
(unbeknownst to me) broke the build. I've updated the dependency,
fixed the build, and pinned the dependency version.
** 0.1.2: Assorted bugfixes

  - not sure if this has always been the case, but the Pinboard API is
     returning a UTF-8 BOM at the start of the response text; strip
     that before parsing
  - the response JSON doesn't always return a Short for use counts;
    sometimes it returns a Number-- handle that.

** 0.1.1: Initial release of `pin'
